# shopify_csv
Process a CSV file, upload imgs to AWS,  change the file to Shopify Product CSV

Have the 10 csv files that are split using the `split_csv.py` script in a pre-output folder, or make sure line 9 on `run10.sh` reflects the right folder. 

Still needs more fine tuning. Running just one process with one file should work. 
Will make sure someone can run all 10 of them.
